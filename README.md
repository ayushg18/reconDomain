### Introducing the reconDomain Toolkit: Empowering Security Enthusiasts

Greetings, fellow security enthusiasts! Welcome to the reconDomain toolkit, designed to bolster your reconnaissance capabilities.

I'm well aware of the pivotal role that reconnaissance plays in the hunt for vulnerabilities within our targets. The initial stages of any hunt are critical, and gathering comprehensive information about our target is paramount. The reconDomain toolkit is meticulously crafted to streamline this process, facilitating the collection of crucial data such as subdomains. It also checks for HTTP status like 200 OK, 404 Not Found, and 403 Forbidden.

Our goal is to empower you to make the most of your time. By utilizing these tools, you can bid farewell to repetitive tasks for each new target. Instead, simply deploy the reconDomain toolkit and watch your efficiency soar.

Discover the realm of reconnaissance like never before with reconDomain: Your partner in effective target reconnaissance.
